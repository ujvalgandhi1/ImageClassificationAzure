# ImageClassification using Azure Cognitive Services

This is a respository for Image Classification on Azure
1. Setting up a classifier on CustomVision.Ai
2. Using Python to cycle through a set of images to test the prediction end point

**Part 1 : Building the initial classifier**
Instructions for building the initial classifier : **[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/getting-started-build-a-classifier](url)**

**Part 2 : Using Python to test the prediction end point and generating tags and probability of the tags**
Refer to the ImageClassification.py code in the Python folder to take a look at the Python code that uses the Prediction End Point and returns the tag name(s) and probability associated with each
